# Vue 3 + Vite

## Vite Journal

This is an application I created with the prof Fernando Herrera, from Vue training course. Great and complete course

Converted to CompositionApi, Script Setup, Typescript, Pinia (for state managament), Vuetify 3.0.1
And also for the first time doing unit testing for Pinia, I used Vitest

In this project I developped an app that manages daily diaries using this utilities:

- firebase (backend)
- cloudinary (api to upload images)
- vitest 0.25.0
- sweet-alert2
